# Task-Tracker
you can add and remove tasks, and also add a reminder ( has no functionality ) by double-clicking on the added task or checking the reminder checkbox before adding it.

This project is developed for training purposes and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Lessons Learned

It was one of my very first experiences working with react, I tried to put what I've learned into practice, and the **state management by prop drilling** was the challenging part.
